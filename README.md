# Extended tools for broadening  the utilization and visualization of perfect packages

As more and more `algorithms` and `perfect packages` were created and developed during fields' rapidly progress. It's really necessary to integrate the advanced `algorithms` into analysis pipelines, especially in our leading edge research. However, it's definitely hard to make a perfect analysis pipelines to fit all studies, cause everyone has some special perspectives to focus on different point in their own data. Hence, a flexible and real-time updating should be the basic principle in this page. 

Here, I will share all the `Extended tools` I made or integrated others into my analysis pipeline recently. And I would show some simple examples to test the usage of `formula` or  `Extended tools` in some specific cases. So far, I had much more experience about the analysis on single cell RNA-seq (scRNA) and single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC) data, hence, I would share more `Extended tools` on scRNA data analysis recently.

Now, let's begin to watch these  `Extended tools` on scRNA data. Here, we split these tools into two parts, including in `scRNA` and `scATAC`.
